Installation
---------------

Stable version
"""""""""""""""""

To install the stable version, the best is to create a virtual environment (using virtualenv, anaconda, poetry, etc) and use:

.. code::

    pip install manim

.. note:: Obviously you need to have **all the dependencies** installed (FFmpeg, LaTeX, etc), see the `docs <https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html>`_ or see this `video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Upztg_Bs-zs&t=98s>`_ made by me.

.. warning:: In this tutorial I will use this version.


Latest version
""""""""""""""""

The most recent version (the one in the master branch of the official repository) can sometimes have some errors, since it is not a stable version, but if you want to use it because you want to have the latest features then see this:
